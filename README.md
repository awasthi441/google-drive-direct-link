How Do <a href="https://drivelinkgen.com/">DirectLinkGen.com</a> Bulk URLs Work for Multiple Google Drive Direct Link Generators?
In the Bulk Option tab on DirectLinkGen.com, you'll find the ability to upload a CSV file if you need to generate links for more than one Google Drive file. To get started, simply copy all the Google Drive links you want to process and paste them into the first column of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Each link should be placed in a separate row in the first column. Afterward, save the file with your preferred name.
Once your CSV file is ready, head back to the Bulk URLs section on DirectLinkGen.com. Upload your CSV file, complete the CAPTCHA, and click Generate Google Drive Direct Bulk Links. The system will process your file and display the number of Google Drive direct links generated. Youâ€™ll also have the option to download the processed file.
When you download the file, you'll see the results in three columns:
1.	The first column will contain the original Google Drive links you uploaded.
2.	The second column will show the corresponding direct links generated by the <a href="https://drivelinkgen.com/">DirectLinkGen.com-Google Drive Direct Link </a>Generator.
3.	The third column will provide the shortened URLs for your Google Drive links, converted through the Google Drive Direct Link Generator.
This simple process allows you to quickly generate and manage multiple direct Google Drive links at once, saving time and streamlining your file-sharing needs.
